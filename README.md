# SoulWorker Server
This is an outdated 'RE' of the soulworker protocol.

My last edit on it was ~11/12/2018.

Updated on 07/13/2019. Crashes on world join for latest KR client with an "invalid movie" error.
(Didn't go through all the packets so some still need to be edited)

No database

"Works" up to in game

Character creation is iffy, some parts are still broken

Unsure if it works on the latest version of the client
